"""Regression: the Windows installer must not spawn a bare ``powershell``.

A user on Windows reported the installer getting stuck; running
``irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1 | iex`` failed at the
uv step with::

    [X] Failed to install uv: The term 'powershell' is not recognized as the
        name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

Root cause: ``Install-Uv`` spawned the astral uv installer via a hardcoded
bare ``powershell`` command.  That name resolves only to *Windows PowerShell*
and only when its System32 directory is on ``PATH``.  Under PowerShell 7+
(``pwsh``) -- or any session where ``powershell`` isn't on ``PATH`` -- the
spawn dies and uv installation aborts.

The fix resolves the PowerShell host executable (preferring the absolute path
of the running host, then ``powershell``/``pwsh`` via ``Get-Command``) and
invokes *that* instead of a bare name.  These tests lock that contract at the
source level (the script only runs on Windows, so there's no runner to
execute it on Linux CI).
